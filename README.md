# ciphers
opgave Caesar 

## Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command in the terminal:

'gcc caesar.c cipher.c -o caesar'

## Usage
To run the program, run the following command in the terminal:

'./caesar'

The program will then prompt you to select an option. Press 'e' to encrypt the text, press 'd' to decrypt the text, or press 'q' to exit the program.

Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt, and then enter the shift value. The shift value should be a number between 0 and 29, inclusive. The program will then prompt you to enter the text again, and the encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed.

Note that the program will not check if the shift value is valid. It is your responsibility to ensure that the shift value is valid before running the program.
